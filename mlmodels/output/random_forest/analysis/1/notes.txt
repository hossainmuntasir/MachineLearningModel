hyperparameters tested:
- n_estimators: 50, 100, 150, 200, 300
- max_features: sqrt(n_features) to n_features/3
- min_samples_split: various from 2 to n_rows/n_features

For all buildings, the best f1 score had min_samples_split=2, which allows 
trees to reach their maximum depth. This is the default value for this 
parameter. The top 10 performing parameters for each building generally had 
min_samples_split values less than 10, with none more than 20.
